## CREW AI AGENT :
- An advanced research assistant by leveraging LangChain-powered tools into a CrewAI-powered multi-agent setup.
- LangChain is a framework enabling developers to easily build LLM-powered applications over their data; it contains production modules for indexing, retrieval, and prompt/agent orchestration.
